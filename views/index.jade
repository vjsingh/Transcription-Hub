        p Transcription Hub was created to provide a central website where everyone can share and discuss transcriptions of jazz solos. Countless transcriptions are scattered throughout the internet on blogs, forums, and personal websites; we hope to gather all of these into one searchable index of every jazz solo.

      h2 Simple Rating System
      p Upload Transcriptions, get upvotes, then request more transcriptions! Every transcription is rated according to a simple Up/Down voting system. A transcriptions score is simply its upvotes minus its downvotes, letting you easily find the most accurate transcriptions. Uploaders are granted Karma 'Notes' for every upvote, which they can use to request new transcriptions. Use your Karma Notes to get your favorite transcription, or upload a requested transcription to get Karma Notes!

      h2 Upload PDFs or links
      p We understand that not everyone has the time to create new transcriptions, and that numerous transcriptions are already available on the web, so in addition to PDFs hosted on Transcription Hub itself, we also allow you to post links to other sites! By doing this, we hope to become the place to come to if you want to search for transcriptions posted all over the internet.
